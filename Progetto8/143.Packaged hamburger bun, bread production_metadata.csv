Geographical representativeness description|The data relate to the production of packaged hamburger bread, made from common wheat flour, of a medium-sized company in Southern Italy. Finished products are sold throughout the country and are also produced for other nationally important brands.|Geographical representativeness|PROCESS INFORMATION
Technology description including background system|The reference technology for energy consumption considers both renewable and non-renewable primary resources installed in plants. Data is provided in aggregate form for the reference year. Furthermore, the total consumption of the entire plant in the reference year was approximately 1,450,000 kWh. The installation of solar panels saved 11.59% energy from the grid ( about 190,000 kWh to be added to the consumption of electricity from the grid).|Technological representativeness|PROCESS INFORMATION

Data selection and combination principles|The company produces bread with both common wheat flour and durum wheat semolina. The production of hamburger buns in the reference year is 3,263,950.63 kg. Data on the consumption of electricity from the grid, from photovoltaic panels and thermal energy is provided in an aggregated manner. it was possible for the consumption of electricity and thermal energy from the grid to be attributed to the different types of output products. The consumption of electricity from photovoltaics, on the other hand, is equally distributed for the different types of bread produced. Transport of raw materials was assumed equal to 150 km.|Data sources treatment and representativeness|MODELLING AND VALIDATION
Data treatment and extrapolations principles|For the quantification of the inputs, the recipe was used to identify the quantities of raw materials needed for production. Electricity and gas consumption are provided in aggregate, but it was possible to identify the consumption required for the production of this product alone.  For the definition of the outputs, it is considered that, in addition to the final product, part of the mass is lost through evaporation as a result of the baking process. This quantity was calculated using multiplication factors provided by the company. The remaining part is attributed to the material losses of the process: burnt dough, waste, residues from baking, which will serve as secondary raw material for the production of breadcrumbs in the company.|Data sources treatment and representativeness|MODELLING AND VALIDATION
