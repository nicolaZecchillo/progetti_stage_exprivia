Type of flow|Flow|Amount|Unit|SD^2 or 2*SD|Description|"Data definition: 
- Estimated (E) - value estimated from assumed data / based on literature data
- Estimated based on measured value (EM) - value estimated from a certain base value (e.g. distribution of total electricity consumption between various phases based on an assumption)
- Calculated (C) - value calculated from measured/certain value
- Measured (M) - measured value reported in official company document (e.g. electricity consumption value from utility bill)"|Evaluation of individual data as indicated in the Pedigree Matrix
